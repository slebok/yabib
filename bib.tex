The attribute grammar formalism is married with the object-oriented paradigm. Arguably, a side effect of this marriage is that the underlying context-free grammar formalism is also married with object orientation, which is interesting in so far that this (early) explanation of the correspondence is exploited nowadays in diverse mapping tools and code generators.

The figure shows two grammars for the same expression language taken from the paper. The first grammar is a conventional context-free grammar in terms of style, whereas the second grammar is restructured to be in an explicitly OO-enabled form. That is, an object model with single inheritance could be derived from the second grammar directly.}

Pretty printing is clearly an important form of language processing. This is not the first paper on a declarative and compositional approach to pretty printing; it stands out though with a very accessible presentation explaining the design and implementation of a (Haskell-based) combinator library for pretty printing. This library can be viewed as providing a simple \emph{embedded language} for pretty printing.

The pretty printing function maps trees to documents; see the reference to the \emph{Doc} type. Pretty printer combinators are used; see `sep' for example.}

The paper discusses the use of interpreters as definitions of languages. There are the notions of defining and defined language (similar to what is also called elsewhere meta and object language). The paper analyzes possible differences between the interpreter-based definition and the formal or informal definition. The paper also discusses different styles of interpreter definition, e.g., a less insightful meta-circular interpreter for a higher-order language versus a first-order interpreter for the same defined language. The issue of application-order dependence is analysed and addressed with continuations.

The generated test data is used for stress tesing the JVM verifier and also for comparative tesing of different verifiers.

The discussion covers indexed files, SQL and database access APIs, object-oriented databases, modern wrapping/mapping-based approaches (e.g., object/relational mapping). The column identifies various problems with data programming: diversity of data modeling and CRUD programming options and the practical need to mix them, difficulties of integrating different type systems and data query/transformation languages, proprietary developments, performance issues, and complexity of support technologies. The discussion also briefly touches some contenders that may address some of the problems. The paper may be a good starting point to look for technical publications on the topic.

(The idea of a triangle is an understatement because there are, of course, more competitors, e.g., Cobol and ontologies.)}

The paper describes an embedding approach for the implementation of domain-specific languages (DSLs). Specifically, DSLs are modeled as language extensions of the underlying host language.

The paper presents the extensible system \emph{Helvetia} which intercepts the compilation pipeline of the Smalltalk host language to seamlessly integrate language extensions. See \cite{Tratt08} for another extensive discussion of language embedding.

The paper addresses the problem of unsafe template instantiation. Such instantiation can be unsafe in the sense that string-level operations are performed at run-time and thus it is not obvious or known at design time whether the described instantiation will actually lead to syntactically correct output eventually. The proposed approach involves the addition of generic template-instantiation concepts to existing language definitions in a generic manner. Thus, template instantiation would only be described in terms of metamodel instantiation, thereby implying syntactically correctness. Similar problems are present in programming languages with a macro system.

The figure, taken from the paper, shows the metamodel for template-instantiation concepts, e.g., a conditional and a loop form.

Whether or not a conditional or a loop is allowed in a certain position also depends on the cardinalities of the model element in the position. There is a generic algorithm to weave the template support in a given metamodel for a language.}
