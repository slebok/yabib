\begin{abstract}

  Software Language Engineering (SLE) is a particular view on Software
  Engineering (SE), which pays specific attention to the many software
  languages that are used in software development. These are not just
  programming languages, but also modeling languages, query and
  transformation languages, schema languages---many of them to be
  considered domain-specific languages. SLE is concerned with design,
  implementation, testing, deployment, and evolution of software
  languages as well as language-based software components.

  \medskip

  The purpose of this annotated bibliography is to contribute to the
  SLE body of knowledge (SLEBOK). The bibliography collects a
  manageable set of papers that cover many principles and practilities
  of SLE in an accessible manner. The intension is to favor more
  fundamental, general papers over specific, highly technical papers.
  The selection is otherwise not very systematic. The SLE and GTTSE
  venues were assumed to provide key papers. Yet other venues, such as
  OOPSLA (SPLASH), ECOOP, and CC as well as special issues on the SLE
  topic or its vicinity were also considered. Several papers were
  simply included based on the author's long-term exposition to SLE
  school of thought. Moreover, several SLE researchers have provided
  advice on what additional papers to include.

  \medskip 

  The bibliography could be useful in teaching. In fact, the selection
  of papers is largely based on what I have covered or wish or could
  imagine to cover in a relatively advanced SLE course.

\section{Metamodel of the bibliography}

The document is generated from a model. The metamodel is given here
informally in terms of how the document looks like. There is one page
per entry with data as follows:

\begin{description}

\item[Key] Descriptor of the paper.

\item[Title] Title of the paper.

\item[Citation] Bibtex citation for the paper.

\item[Online URL] Public access where possible.

\item[Required concepts] Assumed background.

\item[Provided concepts] Knowledge areas served.

\item[Annotation] Description of the paper.

\item[Figure] An illustration.

\end{description}

The illustration consists of an annotated figure, which is taken
either directly from the paper or assembled. Annotations of papers and
their illustrations may also refer to works which are not part of the
selection.
