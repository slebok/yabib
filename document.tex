\begin{abstract}

  Software Language Engineering (SLE) is a particular view on Software
  Engineering (SE), which pays specific attention to the many software
  languages that are used in software development.  These are not just
  programming languages, but also modeling languages, query and
  transformation languages, schema languages, and domain-specific
  languages. Thus, SLE is concerned with design, implementation,
  testing, deployment, and evolution of software languages as well as
  language-based software components.

  \medskip

  The purpose of this richly annotated bibliography is to contribute
  to the SLE body of knowledge (SLEBOK). At this stage, the
  bibliography is not claimed be based on a systematic / structured
  methodology. Instead, the intention it so collect a manageable set
  of papers that cover many principles and practilities of SLE in an
  accessible manner. To this end, the SLE and GTTSE venues were
  considered, but many other papers were considered on the author's
  long-term exposition to SLE school of thought. 

  \medskip 
  The bibliography could be useful in teaching. In fact, the selection
  papes is largely based on what I have covered or will cover in a
  relatively advanced SLE course.

\section{Disclaimer}

This is unfinished work.

\section{Acknowledgment}

The following people have provided me with insights and suggestions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Anya Helene Skrove Bagge
\item Andrei Varanovich
\item Andreas Winter
\item Vadim Zaytsev
\end{itemize}

\noindent
I look forward more collaboration. In fact, I hope to turn this effort
into a proper collaborative effort. For the time being, I am supposed
to look into some of the suggestions received---some of them being
more obvious, given the state (version number) of this effort. They
are mostly concerned with the methodology for collecting and
semantically enriching papers.

\section{Metamodel of the bibliography}

The document is generated from a model. The metamodel is given here
informally in terms of how the document looks like. There is one page
per entry with data as follows:

\begin{description}

\item[Class] article, inproceedings---in the sense of bibtex.

\item[Title] obvious

\item[Author(s)] obvious

\item[Year published] obvious

\item[Online URL] Public access where possible

\item[Required concepts] Assumed background

\item[Provided concepts] Knowledge areas served

\item[Annotation] Obvious

\end{description}

Additional metadata is contained in the underlying model. There is a
second page per entry serving for illustration. The page is dedicated
to a figure taken from the paper or somewhere else, with a caption
addeed. The entries may refer to works which are not in the core
selection. These entries are collected in a plain bibliography.
